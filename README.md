To understand what makes a password strong and evaluate it

Tool used : https://passwordmeter.com/

Steps:
1. Generate 5 passwords for testing
   The passwords are :
       i.aslam123
       ii.Aslam123
       iii.Aslam@123
       iv.Asl@2026#Secure
       v.T9$k!Lx@2026#Pq7

2.Check strength passwords
    strength i password   - 38% (password-1-report.png)
    strength ii password  - 65% (password-2-report.png)
    strength iii password - 83% (password-3-report.png)
    strength iv password  - 100% (password-4-report.png)
    strength v password   - 100% (password-5-report.png)

Strong password includes:

 At least 12–16 characters

Uppercase letters 

Lowercase letters 

Numbers 

Special characters (!, @, #, $, etc.)

 Common Password Attacks are :   
1. Brute Force Attack

An attacker tries every possible combination until the correct password is found

Longer passwords take much more time to crack

2. Dictionary Attack

The attacker uses a list of common words and leaked passwords

Simple passwords like “password123” are easily cracked

3. Credential Stuffing

Attackers use leaked passwords from one site to try logging into other sites

How Complexity Affects Cracking Passwords :

Increasing length dramatically increases cracking time.

Adding symbols and mixed characters increases possible combinations

Random passwords are harder to guess than predictable ones
